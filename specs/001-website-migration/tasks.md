# Tasks: Parsons Ham Radio Club Website Migration to GitHub Pages

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-website-migration/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/formspree-integration.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Manual testing only (no automated tests) - visual regression and functional validation

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This is a static website migration. All paths are relative to repository root:
- HTML files: `/*.html` (19 pages at root)
- CSS: `/style/`, `/pcss/`
- JavaScript: `/res/`, `/appsresources/`
- Images: `/images/`, `/gallery/`, `/pluginAppObj/`
- PHP to delete: `/admin/`, `/imemail/`, `/captcha/`, `/res/*.php`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Prepare repository for migration and validate environment

- [X] T001 Verify all website files are committed to Git repository (check 18 HTML, 47 CSS, 24 JS, 174 images)
- [X] T002 Create feature branch `001-website-migration` from main branch
- [X] T003 [P] Verify .gitignore excludes .claude/, node_modules/, .DS_Store, .specify/memory/* (except constitution.md)
- [X] T004 [P] Document current Raspberry Pi URL for side-by-side testing in research.md

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 Create complete file inventory checklist for visual regression testing (all 18 HTML pages)
- [X] T006 [P] Setup local testing environment: VS Code + Live Server extension installed and verified
- [X] T007 [P] Create backup of all PHP files being deleted (tar.gz archive for reference: admin/, imemail/, captcha/, res/*.php)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 4 - Zero Downtime Migration (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP PART 1

**Goal**: Ensure old Raspberry Pi site stays operational during migration, allowing validation before switchover

**Independent Test**: Old site continues to serve visitors while new GitHub Pages site is being built and tested

**Why Phase 3**: This is executed FIRST (before US1) because it establishes the safety net for the entire migration

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [X] T008 [US4] Verify original site archive is accessible and complete (all 18 pages verified in archive)
- [X] T009 [US4] Document archive-based testing approach for fallback reference in research.md (completed in T004)
- [X] T010 [US4] Create validation checklist (18 pages √ó 7 test criteria = 126 checks) in specs/001-website-migration/validation-checklist.md (completed in T005)
- [X] T011 [US4] Establish rollback procedure documentation: feature branch isolation until validation passes

**Checkpoint**: Safety net established - old site remains operational, rollback plan documented

---

## Phase 4: User Story 1 - Static Website Live on GitHub Pages (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP PART 2

**Goal**: Get core static website live with zero visual changes - 19 pages, all images, galleries, slideshows working identically

**Independent Test**: Navigate to all 19 pages on GitHub Pages URL and verify pixel-perfect match to original site

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) completion
- **User Story 4 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Establishes safety net FIRST
- **User Story 1 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US4 (Phase 3) completion - Main migration work
- **User Story 2 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 (Phase 4) completion - Contact form requires live site
- **User Story 3 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 + US2 completion - Training requires functional site
- **Final Validation (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories (US1, US2, US3, US4) being complete
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on Final Validation (Phase 7) and switchover approval

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories (EXECUTE FIRST)
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after US4 complete - Requires safety net established
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Requires US1 complete (needs live GitHub Pages site for Formspree to work)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Requires US1 + US2 complete (Bob needs functional site for training)

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 4 (Zero Downtime)**:
- Validation checklist before any migration work
- Rollback plan before any changes

**User Story 1 (Static Site)**:
- File deletions before RSS updates (avoid confusion)
- RSS updates can all run in parallel (T019-T036 all marked [P])
- Local validation before GitHub Pages deployment
- Visual regression testing after deployment

**User Story 2 (Contact Form)**:
- Formspree account setup before configuration
- Configuration complete before HTML update
- HTML update before validation testing
- All 8 validation tests before marking story complete

**User Story 3 (Maintenance Workflow)**:
- Training material prep before Bob's environment setup
- Environment setup before hands-on training
- Hands-on training before independent practice
- Independent practice validation before marking story complete

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T001, T003, T004 can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T006, T007 can run in parallel

**User Story 1 File Deletions**: T012, T013, T014, T016, T017 can run in parallel (different directories)

**User Story 1 RSS Updates**: T019-T036 can ALL run in parallel (18 tasks) - each updates a different HTML file

**User Story 1 Visual Regression**: T049-T066 can run in parallel (if multiple people testing) - each tests a different page

**User Story 2 Configuration**: T088-T093 can run in parallel within Formspree dashboard

**Phase 8 (Polish)**: T191, T192, T193, T194 can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 RSS Updates

All 18 RSS feed reference updates can be executed in parallel since each modifies a different HTML file:

```bash
# Launch all RSS updates together (T019-T036):
Edit: index.html line 33
Edit: contact.html line 24
Edit: about-us.html line 24

## Implementation Strategy

### Sequential Execution (Recommended for Solo Work)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T007)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 4 - Zero Downtime (T008-T011) ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Safety net FIRST
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 1 - Static Site (T012-T082) ‚¨ÖÔ∏è MVP core functionality
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently (133 visual checks)
6. Complete Phase 5: User Story 2 - Contact Form (T083-T119)
7. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 2 independently (8 validation tests)
8. Complete Phase 6: User Story 3 - Training (T120-T158) ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Requires Bob's participation
9. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 3 independently (Bob completes solo exercises)
10. Complete Phase 7: Final Validation (T159-T190) ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Includes 30-day monitoring
11. Complete Phase 8: Polish (T191-T200)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel if multiple people working
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability and independent testing
- **Checkpoints**: Stop points to validate each user story works independently before proceeding
- **Manual testing only**: No automated tests - this is a static site migration, not software development
- **Constitution compliance**: All tasks align with 7 core principles (preserve UX, zero cost, static-first, etc.)
- **Commit frequency**: Commit after logical groups (e.g., all RSS updates in one commit, all file deletions in one commit)
- **Testing thoroughness**: 133 visual regression checks (19 pages √ó 7 criteria) + 8 form validation tests = 141 total validations
- **Bob's participation required**: Phase 6 (US3) requires Bob to be present for training and exercises
- **Total tasks**: 200 tasks (includes 30-day monitoring period in Phase 7)
