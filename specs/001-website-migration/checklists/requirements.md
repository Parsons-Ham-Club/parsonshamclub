# Specification Quality Checklist: Parsons Ham Radio Club Website Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification avoids implementation details. All references to technologies are in context of migration constraints (existing x5engine.js, jQuery, etc.) not new implementations. Focus is on user experience and business value (zero cost, zero downtime, maintainability).

✅ **PASS** - Written for stakeholders: user stories use plain language ("ham radio club member", "prospective ham radio operator", "Bob Hoffman"), not technical jargon.

✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections complete: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all populated with comprehensive detail.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in specification. All decisions made based on constitution and thorough codebase research.

✅ **PASS** - Requirements are testable: Each FR specifies concrete verification (e.g., "All 19 HTML pages MUST display", "All 174 image files MUST display", specific calendar ID, specific email address).

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are measurable: Specific metrics provided (19 pages, 174 images, <3 seconds load time, 99.9% uptime, <10 minutes for tasks, 90+ mobile score, $0/year cost).

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic: Focused on user outcomes ("pages load successfully", "images display correctly", "Bob can complete update") not implementation ("database query time", "API response code").

✅ **PASS** - All acceptance scenarios defined: 4 user stories with 5 acceptance scenarios each (20 total), all in Given/When/Then format.

✅ **PASS** - Edge cases identified: 8 edge cases documented with expected behavior.

✅ **PASS** - Scope clearly bounded: Explicitly states what's in scope (19 pages, contact form, embeds) and what's out (search removed initially, RSS manual updates).

✅ **PASS** - Dependencies and assumptions identified: 10 assumptions documented covering browser support, form volume, update frequency, etc.

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS** - All 35 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories or success criteria.

✅ **PASS** - User scenarios cover all primary flows: View site (US1), Contact club (US2), Maintain site (US3), Zero downtime (US4).

✅ **PASS** - Measurable outcomes align with feature goals: 15 success criteria covering completeness, performance, maintainability, cost, and functionality.

✅ **PASS** - No implementation leakage: GitHub Pages, Formspree, VS Code are mentioned as constraints from constitution, not as design decisions in spec.

## Overall Status

**✅ SPECIFICATION APPROVED** - All quality checks passed. Specification is complete, unambiguous, testable, and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

## Notes

- Specification exceptionally detailed due to thorough codebase research completed before spec creation
- All user stories are independently testable as required
- Priority levels appropriately assigned (P1 for MVP, P2 for critical features, P3 for maintenance training)
- Constitution principles (UI preservation, zero cost, maintainability) clearly reflected in requirements
- No clarifications needed - all decisions grounded in existing codebase analysis
